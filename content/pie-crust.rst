    =========== ===========================
    Quantity     Ingredient
    =========== ===========================
    12 tbsp     very cold unsalted butter
    3 cups      all-purpose flour
    1 tsp       kosher salt
    1 tbsp      sugar
    1/3 cup     very cold vegetable shortening
    6 - 8 tbsp  (about 1/2 cup) ice water
    =========== ===========================

Directions
============

#. Dice the butter and return it to the refrigerator while you prepare the
   flour mixture.
#. Place the flour, salt, and sugar in the bowl of a food processor
   fitted with a steel blade and pulse a couple times to mix.
#. Add the butter and shortening.
#. Pulse until the butter is the pea sized, maybe 8 to 12 times.
#. With the machine running, pour the ice water down the feed tube
   and pulse the machine until the dough begins to form a ball.
#. Dump out on a floured board and roll into a ball.
#. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
#. Cut the dough in half. Roll each piece on a well-floured board
   into a circle, rolling from the center to the edge, turning
   and flouring the dough to make sure it doesn't stick to the board.
#. Fold the dough in half, place in a pie pan, and unfold to fit the pan.
#. Repeat with the top crust.

Notes
======

* Make sure return the butter to the refrigerator. The crust works much when
  it is cold.
* Sticks of butter are 8 tbsp. So 12 tbsp is about a stick and a half.
