Ingredients:
================

- 3 broccoli crowns 
- 2 tbsp. lemon juice (about 1 lemon)
- 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes
- salt and pepper to taste
- 4 bulbs of garlic, reserving 1 clove
- 1 cup avocado oil (more or less depending on size of pot)

- 1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese, plus more for garnish

Instructions:
=================

#. Peel 4 bulbs of garlic, reserving one clove. Place in a shallop pot with just enough avocado oil to cover. Cook over low-medium heat, ensuring there aren’t too many bubbles. Cook until garlic is soft but doesn’t change color much, about an hour.
#. Remove garlic from oil and place into blender with entire bottle of hot sauce and a couple tsp of the garlic oil. Blend until smooth.
#. Add a few tsp. of garlic oil to skillet and sauce broccoli until charred and just starting to get tender. Add salt, black pepper, red chili flakes, and sliced clove of garlic from before. Sauce until garlic starts to toast. Add lemon juice and cook until broccoli is desired tenderness.
#. Spoon 1/4 cup of ricotta into a bowl. Serve broccoli on top and drizzle over garlic/hot sauce mixture. Sprinkle parmesan on top. 
#. Serve sliced bread on the side for dipping.
