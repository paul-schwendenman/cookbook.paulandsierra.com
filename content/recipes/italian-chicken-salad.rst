Chicken Salad
==============

- 2 1/2 lbs of chicken breast
- 2 stalks of celery, diced
- 1 red bell pepper, chopped
- 1/2 cup of sliced almonds (1/2 bag)
- 1/4 to 1/2 of a medium red onion, diced
- 1/4 cup of chopped parsley
- 1 package of bacon, cooked and chopped
- olive oil
- salt
- black pepper

Vinegarette
============

- 2 tbsp red wine vinegar
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1 tsp dijon mustard
- 1/2 tsp salt
- black pepper
- 1/2 cup olive oil

Instructions:
--------------


#. Preheat the oven to 425˚ F
#. Put chicken breasts on a baking sheet. Rub olive oil on the chicken and then salt and
   pepper both sides to season.
#. Cook chicken in oven for 30-40 mins, until done. The recommended internal temp of poultry is 165˚ F.
#. While the chicken is cooking, toast your almonds in a skillet for about five minutes until they are
   fragrant and golden brown and remove from skillet and set aside
#. In the warm skillet, cook your bacon and set aside to cool
#. Dice your vegetables. I found my bell pepper ended up being about a cup, so I chopped
   enough celery to match and then about half that amount of onion and parsley.
#. Chop the bacon into dime to nickle size pieces
#. Make Vinegarette by combining the vinegar, mustard, sugar, salt and pepper in a small
   bowl. And then whisk the contents while adding the oil to emulsify the dressing.
#. Once the chicken is cooked, remove from the oven and let it sit for at least five minutes allowing it to cool slightly.
#. Shred chicken once cool enough to handle and place in a large bowl.
#. Add celery, peppers, onion, almonds, bacon, and parsley to the bowl and mix.
#. Pour dressing over the the chicken salad mixture and mix
#. Serve on bread or in wraps
