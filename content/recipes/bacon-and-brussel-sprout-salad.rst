Ingredients
============

For the dressing:
------------------

- juice of one lemon
- juice of one orange
- 2–3 tablespoons apple cider (not vinegar, just regular apple cider! for sweetness!)
- 1 shallot, minced
- 1/2 cup olive oil
- 1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper to taste

For the salad:
---------------

- 3 bags raw brussels sprouts (or 1/2 head shredded cabbage plus 1 bunch of kale)
- 1 cup slivered almonds
- 6 slices cooked veggie bacon, chopped
- 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese (Asiago or Gruyere are also good)

Instructions
=============

#. Combine the lemon juice, orange juice, apple cider, and shallots in a small bowl.
   Add the olive oil in a steady stream and whisk for a minute or two, until it
   becomes creamy-looking.
#. Slice the brussels sprouts with a mandoline, taking care of your fingers! and
   slicing them as thin as possible. This works best when you hold the stem, slice
   from the top, and stop with a little bit left at the bottom, discarding the
   remaining bottom stem part since it’s not very leafy anyway. The thinner the shreds,
   the better the salad! Toss the shreds and loosen them with your fingers to they
   separate and fluff a little bit.
#. Toss the brussels sprouts, almonds, bacon, cheese, and dressing together. Serve
   immediately or within a few hours of tossing.
