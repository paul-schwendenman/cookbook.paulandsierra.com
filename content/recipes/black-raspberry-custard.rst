Vanilla Custard Base

#. Wisk together egg yolks, sugar and a pinch of salt in a large bowl

   to a boil.
#. Let steep for 5 to 10 mins
#. Prepare an ice bath
#. Using a laddle, add half of the dairy to the egg mixture slowly while wisking with your other hand
#. Pour the egg-dairy mixture back into the saucepan with the remaining dairy
#. Warm using low heat while stirring constantly until the mixture thickens enough that
   it doesn't run back together when separated on the spoon
#. Remove from heat and strain using a fine mesh strainer
#. Place mixture in the ice bath and stir until cool to the touch, refrigerate over night


Ice cream

#. Add the custard base to the ice cream machine and churn until consistency of soft soft serve

#. About five minutes before the ice cream is ready, add the berries, liquid and the chocolate chuncks
#. Freeze until firm


Notes
=======

- The original author recomends chilling the custard base overnight in
  the refrigerator. Mixing the custard until is has the texture of softserve
  and then freezing for 4 hours
- Covering the ice cream directly with wax paper helps to prevent freezer burn
- The chocolate is optional
