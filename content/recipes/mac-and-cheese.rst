Ingredients

- 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, plus more for baking dish
- Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper
- 3 cups elbow macaroni
- 2 (12-ounce) cans evaporated milk
- 1/3 cup skim milk
- 2 large eggs

Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Generously butter a 13-by-9-inch glass baking dish; set
   aside. Bring a large pot of water to a boil; add salt and macaroni. Cook until al dente
   according to package directions. Drain, and return to pot. Add butter and toss until pasta
   is coated and butter has melted; set aside.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together evaporated milk, skim milk, and eggs. Add seasoned
   salt, garlic powder, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper; set aside. In another
   medium bowl, combine cheeses; set aside.
3. Place 1/3 macaroni in an even layer in the bottom of prepared baking dish; cover evenly
   with 1/3 cheese. Repeat with remaining macaroni and cheese mixture. Pour milk mixture
   evenly over contents of baking dish. Sprinkle with paprika. Bake until top layer is lightly
   browned, 35 to 45 minutes. Let stand 10 to 15 minutes before serving.
