Ingredients
===============================

- 4-6 cups of berries
- 1 cup of sugar
- 3 tbsp of corn starch, dissolved in cold water
- 1 tbsp of unsalted butter

- 1/2 tsp of cinnamon
- 1/4 cup of melted unsalted butter

Instructions
======================

#. Preheat an oven to 350 â„‰
#. Grease a cast iron pan with butter [#]_
#. Combine 1/2 berries, sugar, dissolved corn starch, and butter in the saucepan
#. Cook on medium heat until a syrup forms (5 mins)

#. Combine all topping ingredients with a fork in a medium sized bowl
#. Add oat mixture to the top of the berries in the cast iron
#. Bake for 40-45 mins


Notes and Tips
===============

- In the original recipe, the syrup was made and then added on the berries. I've
  read this wrong, and was adding the berries immediately. This makes a jelly and the
  berries are mostly cooked down. I have addapted the recipe to respresent a compromize
  between these two styles in hopes of preserving more whole berries
- I have tried doubling the topping mixture, it seemed to work well. I'd recommend 1 1/2
  the normal amount for a 10in pan
- You can subsitute red raspberries or blackberries if you don't have access to whole berries
- A cup of black raspberries seems to weigh about 130 grams [#]_
- Refrigerate freshly picked berries to prevent spoiling
