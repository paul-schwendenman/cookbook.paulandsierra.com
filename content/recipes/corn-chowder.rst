Ingredients
=============

- 1 tbsp. vegetable oil (I like avocado oil)
- 5 ears of Corn, sliced off the cob (or three bags frozen corn)
- 1 Red Bell Pepper, diced
- 1 small Red Onion, diced
- 2 cloves of Garlic, minced
- 1 Jalapeno, diced and seeds removed
- ½ bunch of Cilantro, separated into stems and leaves and chopped
- ½ tsp Paprika
- 4 oz Cream Cheese
- 3 cups Gold Potatoes, diced into small pieces (I left the skin on)
- 4 cups Vegetable Broth
- 1 tsp Salt, or to taste
- Optional: Lime wedges, for serving

Instructions
=============

#. Add the Corn to a large non-stick pot over Medium-High Heat with the vegetable oil. If your Corn is dry, add 1 tbsp. of Water to the pot as well to get things going. “Sear” the Corn for 10-12 minutes, stirring occasionally to ensure that all sides are evenly cooking. The Corn will gradually become brown around the edges.
#. Deglaze the pot with 1/2 cup of water.
#. Add the Bell Pepper, Red Onion, Garlic, Jalapeño, Cilantro Stems, Garlic, and Smoked Paprika to the pot; reduce the heat to medium and sauté until the Onion is translucent.
#. Add the Cream Cheese to the pot and mix it in with the veggies until it is evenly distributed. Then, add the Gold Potatoes and Vegetable Broth, stirring well.
#. Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low and let simmer for 10-12 minutes, or until the Potatoes are tender.
#. Transfer half of the soup into a Blender and carefully blend until smooth and creamy; return this to the pot, then mix well.
#. Divide the soup into bowls, then top with Cilantro leaves and a squeeze of fresh Lime.
#. Serve with shredded cheddar and/or tortilla chips
