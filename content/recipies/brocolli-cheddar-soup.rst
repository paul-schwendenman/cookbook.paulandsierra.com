Ingredients
==============

- 2 heads broccoli, chopped (3-4 crowns)
- 4 tablespoons butter
- ½ onion, diced
- ¼ cup flour
- 2 cups half & half (1 bottle)
- 2 cups vegetable stock (1 box)
- ½ cup shredded carrots (3 to 4 carrots, peeled and grated)
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1 teaspoon pepper
- ¼ teaspoon nutmeg
- 2 cups grated cheddar cheese
- 1 dash paprika (optional)

Preparation
=============

#. Trim the stems off the broccoli heads and chop into small florets. Peel and grate
   the carrots. Dice the onion.
#. In a large pot over medium heat, combine the butter and onion and sauté until
   translucent. Add the flour and stir until the mixture lightly browns. Stir
   in the half-and-half and mix until the contents reach a simmer. Turn the
   heat to low and add the stock. Simmer for 5-10 minutes.
#. Mix in the broccoli, carrots, salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Simmer for 10-15
   minutes. Add the cheese and stir until it melts and combines with the
   other ingredients.
#. Enjoy!

Notes
======

- I have taken to using the full amounts of the ingredient, i.e whole box of stock, whole bottle of cream, etc.
- Consider slicing further into the stem of the broccoli
- Use stick blender after adding stock to help emulsify
