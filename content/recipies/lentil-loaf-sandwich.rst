Instructions
===============

#. Caramelize onion in large cast iron skillet. Remove and set aside.

#. If using leftover caramelized onions, add butter to skillet and reheat then complete above step
#. Add more butter and fry lentil loaf until slightly browned on sides
#. Mix ketchup, mayo, and mustards, adjusting proportions to taste.
#. Smear condiment mixture on inside of all pieces of bread. On left piece of bread, add caramelized onions, then lentil loaf, then pickles followed by second piece of bread. Repeat.
