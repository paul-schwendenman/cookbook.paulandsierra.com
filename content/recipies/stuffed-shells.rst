- 2 32 oz spaghetti sauce (I like Carfagna’s)
- 2 15 oz cartons ricotta cheese

- 2 large eggs
- 2 tsp. parsley flakes
- 1 tsp. salt

Instructions:
===============

#. Cook shells until just flexible enough to fill, about 12 minutes. Rinse under cold water.
#. Preheat oven to 350.
#. Mix ricotta, mozzarella, parmesan, eggs, parsley, salt, and pepper.
#. Using a 9x13” baking dish and another 8x8” baking dish, pour a layer of spaghetti sauce in the bottom of each dish.
#. Fill each shell with about 2 tsp. of cheese mixture (may need to go back and add more at the end to use up all the filling).
#. Place shells in single layer on top of sauce in baking dishes.
#. Cover with foil and bake for 45 minutes.
#. Take out and let sit for 15 minutes.
#. Heat remaining sauce on stove top and spoon over shells when serving.
